# Constants

These are the magic numbers and stuff for reference. I really hate having to write this. I haven't really handled the error handling well.



## Custom Error Codes ##

If your request returns status code `418` [(teapot joke status)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418), then you have received a special error code, congrats! You managed to mess up so bad that we had to invent new error messages just for the occasion!.

your custom code is delivered via `<response>.customstatuscode`. Use the table below to decode the message

| code | error | detailed description |
| ---- | ----- | -------------------- |
|      |       |                      |
